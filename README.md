### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related for web development, since they both aim to enhance the user experience under suboptimal conditions. Graceful degradation ensures that a web app continues to function with reduced capabilities when certain advanced features are unavailable. Service workers further accent this approach by enabling offline capabilities, caching info and assets, and intercepting network requests to serve as a fallback. This means that even with network issues, service workers help maintain a base usable experience, aligning with the principles of graceful degradation.
